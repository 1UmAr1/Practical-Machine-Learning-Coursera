# Practical-Machine-Learning-Coursera
Hey
This is the project of Course practical machine learning 
In this i have performed explotory analysis and first 
Then i have used Decision tree as the first learning algo which was not promising
I have also ploted the dendogram as proof
 
As my final model i used Random Forest with 5 fold cross validation
Which was very much promising
